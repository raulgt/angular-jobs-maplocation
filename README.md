# LISTMAP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9.

## Specifications

- This project uses Bootstrap 5 and Angular Material, they are not commonly used together but is intended for testing purposes.
- Some css libraries have been added directly in index.html (for time reasons) or copied in assets, it is recommended to move them to assets (if they are not there) and reference them in the angular.json file.
- The api has been intended to work with asynchronous paging, again for time reasons, we have taken only the first set of jobs. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
